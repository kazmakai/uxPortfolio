          <ol>
            <li>Insufficient organizers limit the ability to fulfill event demand, resulting in unmet community needs and potential disengagement</li>
            <li>Lack of engagement beyond events diminishes community connection and may hinder sustained participation and growth</li>
            <li>Members want to initiate events but the process but donâ€™t want the commitment of running an official group</li>

        <div className='text-container'>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
          A dynamic platform fostering the sharing of artworks, hosting informal gatherings, and providing a supportive forum for amateur artists in Tokyo to make meaning connections through art.

            <li>I created and sent out a questionnaire aimed at collecting demographic, behavioral, and motivational data from members, which eventually received 25 responses.</li>
