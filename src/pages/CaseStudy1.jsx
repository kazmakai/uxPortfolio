"Besides the constant complaints from members about how the Meetup platform is buggy and slow, I wanted to delve deeper into the other issues members might be experiencing, particularly regarding how we run our events and group."</li>
            <li>I sent out a questionnaire aimed at collecting demographic, behavioral, and motivational data from members, which eventually received 25 responses.</li>
